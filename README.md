Usage
-----

Download [a webapp package](https://github.com/spotboard/spotboard/releases), and serve it using any HTTP server.
We recommend `http-server -c-1` (disable cache) or `nginx`.

You'll also need to set up the feedserver (PC^2 or Domjudge), as described below.


Usage (for PC^2)
----------------

*TL;DR)* Setup the `config.yaml`, then launch the spotboard server application.

```
$ vim config.yaml
$ java -jar spotboard-server.jar
```

Spotboard consists of two main modules: a static **web application**, and the **feedserver** (an API server) which provides contest information [in JSON][json_sample].

- The web application can be hosted using commonly-used web servers such as Nginx and Apache,
  or using the embedded web server provided. See the [detailed documentation](docs/webapp.md).
- The feedserver should provide the contest information and all the runs (submissions) during the contest.
  It is shipped with *off-the-shelf* bridges to other programming contest systems such as PC^2.
  See the [detailed documentation](docs/feedserver.md).
